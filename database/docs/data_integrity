# Data Integrity

## Naming Conventions

### Tables
* Use nouns to describe the table.
* Avoid abbreviations and acronyms.
* Use PascalCase.
* Use plural form of the word.
    * Append an 's' to the word for pluralization.
    * In instances where an 's' cannot simply be appened... (hasn't happend yet...).

### Columns
* Use nouns to describe the data contained in the column.
* Use all lowercase with words separated by underscores.
* Avoid cryptic abbreviations and acronyms.
    * Be sure to describe in the data dictionary any abbreviations or acronyms used.
* Use singular form of the word.
    * E.g. `study` in a table of `Studies`.
* Primary keys:
    * Use the `tableName_id` pattern where `_id` is appended to the singular-form table name.
    * E.g. `study_id`.
* Foreign keys:
    * Use the `fk__ForeignKeyTable__PrimaryKeyTable` pattern.
    * E.g. `fk__Visits_Studies`

## Data Types

* Use the most appropriate data type and allocate a reasonable amount of bytes to adequately store the data.

## Foreign Keys
* Use foreign keys to enforce relationships between tables.
* Use foreign keys in a manner that will yield robust relationships without overencumbering the columns/tables.

## Constraints
* Use constraints to enforce data validation.
